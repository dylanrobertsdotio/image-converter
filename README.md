# Image Converter

A simple tool for resizing images and converting them to webp format.

## Getting Started

To use this tool, you must have Node.js installed locally. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

Run the following command to install required dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

## Usage

1. Create an `input` directory in the root directory.
2. Inside of the `input` directory, create directories named after the sizes. For example `512x512`.
3. Drag images into their respective folder.
4. Run the command `npm start` from your terminal. This will produce an `output` directory with all of your resized images in `webp` format.
